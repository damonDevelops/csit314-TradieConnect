# TradieConnect README

## About the Project
This repository is for the development of a system for the University of Wollongong, the subject is CSIT314 (Systems Development Methodologies). The system will allow two types of users, a Tradie (tradesperson) and a customer who requires the services of a tradesperson. The customer can put out a request for a Trade service that needs doing (tiling, plumbing, electrical etc) which will be broadcast to all Tradies that qualify. The Tradies can then choose to apply for the job and finally the customer can review applied Tradies and accept a job. The system will include other functions and features such as reviewing work, generating reports and managing their payment type.
